            This site is being built through a unique collaborative process between human curiosity
            and AI mentorship. Rather than simply researching and writing content, I work directly
            with Amazon Q to build my technical understanding through active dialogue. I explain my
            mental model of each step, Amazon Q validates and refines it with technical feedback,
            and we iterate until we're both confident the understanding is solid. Only then do we
            code the validated content.

            Each step involves fascinating technical complexity that we'll explore together, from
            DNS cache hierarchies to cloud infrastructure routing to browser rendering engines.
