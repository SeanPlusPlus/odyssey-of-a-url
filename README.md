# 🌐 Odyssey of a URL

A deep dive into what really happens when you type a web address into your browser and hit **Enter**. From DNS lookups to AWS infrastructure, down through the DOM and render tree inside your browser, this project follows the full odyssey of a URL.

## 🤝 Collaborative Development Method

This site is being built through a unique collaborative process between human curiosity and AI mentorship. Rather than simply researching and writing content, I work directly with Amazon Q to build my technical understanding through active dialogue.

**The Process:**

1. **I explain my mental model** - I describe what I think happens at each step of the URL journey
2. **Amazon Q validates and refines** - Acting as a "Super Wise Engineer" mentor, Q provides technical feedback on what's accurate, what needs correction, and fills in gaps with precise technical details
3. **We iterate until aligned** - We continue the dialogue until we're both confident the technical understanding is solid
4. **Only then do we code** - Once we agree on the concepts, Q updates the components with the validated content

This approach ensures the educational content is both technically accurate and built from genuine understanding rather than copied explanations. Each section represents a real learning journey, with misconceptions corrected and mental models refined through collaborative technical discussion.

The result is content that's not just correct, but deeply understood - making it more authentic and educational for visitors who are on their own learning journey.

## 🚀 Overview

This is a **single-page site** that walks through the journey of a URL:

1. **DNS Resolution** – how your browser finds the right server.
2. **AWS & Routing** – requests traveling through the cloud.
3. **TLS & HTTP** – secure handshakes and fetching resources.
4. **Browser Parsing** – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
5. **DOM & Render Tree** – turning code into structure and style.
6. **Painting & Compositing** – pixels drawn to the screen.
